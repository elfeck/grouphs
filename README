This project provides a simple group data type for Haskell as well as
functionality to examine finite groups.

Note that the implementation is awful and slow.

Important files:

(*) src/Group.hs    contains the data type definition and main functionality
(*) src/*Group.hs   contains a certain type of finite group
(*) test/Test.hs    contains main and testing
