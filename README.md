This project provides a simple group data type for Haskell, as well as
functionality to examine finite groups.

Note, that the implementation is awful and slow.

Important files:

* __Groups.hs__ contains the data type definition and main functionality
* __*Group.hs__ contains a certain type of finite group
* __Test.hs__ contains main and testing
